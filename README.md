# Convolutional Neural Network Visualizations 

This repository is an attempt for me to visually represent the inner workings of convolutional neural networks. This work is by no means revolutionary, however, I am trying to illustrate various methods for representing how a CNN makes decisions. In this effort I hope to understand the fine details of CNNs. Deep neural networks do not have to be black boxes. It may seem that it is some miracle that a model can identify a cat in an image, but believe me, it's not. It's just really complicated math under the hood. I believe that every ML engineer should understand how their model makes decisions, which ultimatly should answer questions related to bias. I'm new at this so bare with me...

## Installing Locally

If you are new to this, feel free to install locally and make it your own.
1. Install dependencies (I recommended that you create an environment in Conda-Python3)
`pip install requirments.txt`
2. The following notebooks outline visualization steps:
* `cnn_filter_visualizations.ipynb` Jupyter notebook 


## Techniques Explored

* [Loading the Model](#load_the_model)
* [Filter Visualization](#filter_visualization)
* [Feature Map Visualization](#feature_map_visualization)
